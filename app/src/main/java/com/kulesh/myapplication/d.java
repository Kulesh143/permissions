//Using implicit Intent, component canâ€™t be specifying. An action to be performed is declared by implicit intent.
//Then android operating system will filter out component which will response to the action.
//
//        Using explicit intent any other component can be specified. In other words, the targeted component
//        is specified by explicit intent. So only the specified target component will be invoked.
